# p5_Stage2

Includes the p5 MIDI API plugin from https://github.com/therewasaguy/p5.midi.
When receiving midi input, midi data from two channels is printed to the canvas and logged to the console.

A really basic api for the Novation launchcontrol.
Printing the midi data to screen, ugly conditionals to differentiate between pads and knobs, image mapped to 0 to 127 for resizing with knob. Other stuff commented out.
